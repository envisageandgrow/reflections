Notes about git:

git log --graph --oneline master coins


When I delete a branch:

If a branch is deleted and leaves some commits unreachable from existing branches, those commits will continue to be accessible by commit id, until Git’s garbage collection runs. This will happen automatically from time to time, unless you actively turn it off. You can also run this process manually with git gc.


For abort merge

git merge --abort


To compare a commit to its parent is git show commit_id
